# 50 Shaders of Grey
 in honor of a book i've never read and really because I finally want to actually learn how to make shaders, here are 50 grey shaders in godot 4!

[See the shaders here!](https://bezark.github.io/50-Shaders-of-Grey/Export/)

Inspired by [Post-Processing Shaders as a Creative Medium](https://blog.maximeheckel.com/posts/post-processing-as-a-creative-medium/) among others.
